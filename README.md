📌 Graph Algorithm Visualizer — Interactive Simulator for Shortest Paths & MST

An interactive web-based visualization tool that demonstrates how classic graph algorithms work step-by-step in real time. This project visually simulates Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms on dynamically generated graphs with smooth animations and collision-free layouts.

🚀 Features

🎯 Live algorithm animations with step-by-step edge relaxation

🌐 Random graph generator with guaranteed connectivity

🧠 Collision-aware layout (no node overlap, no edge crossings)

🌲 Real-time MST construction in separate panel

🎨 Dynamic color states for traversal, evaluation, and selection

⚡ Smooth async rendering engine using JavaScript Canvas

🧩 Geometry-based validation for edge placement
